If you were invited to an existing project in Iterator, clicking the link in your invitation email will take you directly to that project in the app.

If you signed up for an account yourself, after confirming your email and setting your password, you’ll land on your [Dashboard](https://app.iteratorpm.com).

## Creating a New Project

Whether or not you’ve been added to existing projects, you can create a new project:

* Click **Create Project** in the top-right of the Dashboard, or
* Click the Iterator logo in the top-left and select **Create Project** from the dropdown menu.

![Create Project](/images/creating_a_project_1.png)

Once you begin, a dialog will appear with the following options:

---

### 1. **Project Name**

Enter a name for your project.

---

### 2. **Account**

* If you were invited to another project, you may not yet have permissions to create your own.
* If needed, ask the account owner or admin to grant you [project creator access](/docs/accounts/account-roles#creator_role).
* You can also create your own new account, but it will be separate from your organization’s existing accounts.

---

### 3. **Project Privacy**

* **Private**: Only invited members can access the project.
* **Public**: Anyone can view the project in read-only mode (ideal for open source). [Learn more](/docs/public-projects).
* Public projects don’t count against your plan limits. You can change privacy settings later in [Project Settings](/docs/project-settings).

> **Note:** [Account owners and admins](/docs/account_member_roles) can see all private projects in their account but can only access them in read-only mode unless they add themselves as a [project owner or member](/docs/project_member_roles).

Click **Create** to finalize your project.

---

## After Project Creation

Once your project is created, you’ll land in the **project view**.

By default, it shows two panels:

* **Current/Backlog** (current iteration + prioritized upcoming stories)
* **Icebox** (unprioritized ideas)

Use the **Panel Actions** menu to split Current from Backlog.

You can customize your workflow and panels from here.

## Project Settings & Navigation

Click the **MORE** tab at the top of the project to:

* Edit [Project Settings](/docs/changing_project_settings)
* Add details in the [Project Profile](/docs/describe_your_project)
* Manage [Project Members](/docs/add_remove_project_members)
* View [Reports](/docs/analytics_charts_and_reports_overview)
* Configure [Integrations](/docs/integrations_overview)
* [Import/Export CSV](/docs/csv_import_export)

---

## Feature Tour

After creating your first project, take the **Feature Tour**. If you skipped it, you can access it from the **Help** menu at any time.

---

## Sidebar Overview

In the sidebar, you’ll see:

* Your average [velocity](/docs/understanding_velocity)
* View controls like **Density** and **Auto/Fixed** panel width
* A toggle to collapse/expand the sidebar

![Sidebar Menu](https://app.iteratorpm.com/help/assets/icon_sidebar_menu.png)

---

## Using Panels

Each panel includes a **Panel Actions** menu. You can:

* Select all stories
* [Clone panels](/docs/using_story_panels#clone_panels)
* Start [adding stories](/docs/adding_stories) by clicking the **+** in the header

---

## Example Project Walkthrough

Let’s look at a sample project layout.

![Example Project](https://app.iteratorpm.com/help/assets/gettingstarted_add_project_image4.png)

* The **My Work** panel shows assigned and delivered stories. [Learn more](/docs/mywork_panel)
* Combined **Current/Backlog** shows planned iterations. The grey markers show iteration details.
* Tracker uses [velocity](/docs/understanding_velocity) to plan upcoming iterations automatically.

Unprioritized stories live in the **Icebox**. Keep it clean with these [management tips](/docs/managing_the_icebox).

---

## Additional Panels

You can open more panels from the sidebar:

* **Done**: Completed iterations and accepted stories
* **[Epics](/docs/tracking_big_features_themes_with_epics)**: Large feature groupings
* **Labels**: Filter and organize by custom tags
* **[Blockers](/docs/blocked_stories)**: View stories with unresolved dependencies
* **Project History**: Full change log

Drag and reorder panels as needed.

---

## Adding Stories & Migrating

You’re ready to begin adding stories.

Need to migrate stories from another tool? Check out the [migration guide](/docs/migrating_from_third_party).

> **Note:** In new projects, stories added to the Backlog will move to the Current panel automatically if they fit within your project’s [velocity](/docs/understanding_velocity). Think of the Current panel as the “top of your backlog”—where the most important stories go first.

---

## Project Settings

Only project owners can modify [Project Settings](/docs/changing_project_settings). Access them via the **MORE** tab or the **Settings** gear icon.
