# What is Iterator?

**Iterator** is an open-source, beta-stage project planning tool designed to help software development teams build realistic expectations around timelines and deliverables. While in beta, Iterator is **completely free to use**.

Inspired by the simplicity and clarity of Pivotal Tracker (now defunct), Iterator helps your team break projects down into manageable "stories" (virtual cards) and move them through your workflow. This approach makes it easier to have meaningful conversations around scope, priorities, and progress.

As your team estimates and prioritizes stories, Iterator automatically organizes them into future iterations. Over time, it learns from your team's natural pace of work to predict when upcoming work will likely be completed. The shared view of priorities ensures everyone knows what’s being worked on, what’s next, and when it’s expected to be done.

Iterator supports a practical, lightweight agile workflow—helping your team stay on track, adapt quickly, and deliver consistently.
