[Workspaces](/docs/terminology#workspace) in **Iterator** let you manage multiple projects from a single view. With Workspaces, you can:

* View multiple project backlogs side by side
* Drag and drop stories between projects
* Search across all projects
* See your [My Work](/docs/mywork_panel) items across projects
* [Share your Workspace setup](/docs/sharing_workspaces) with others

You can access and manage Workspaces from the [Dashboard](/docs/dashboard) or via the Projects dropdown in Iterator’s top navigation bar.

## Adding Projects to a Workspace

To set up a Workspace, simply choose the projects you want to include. A few clicks is all it takes to get started.

## Why Use Workspaces?

Workspaces make cross-project collaboration easy and transparent. They’re especially helpful if your team works across multiple codebases—like a backend service, frontend UI, and mobile app. You can also use Workspaces to coordinate related design, QA, and DevOps efforts, and to [manage dependencies](/docs/handling_dependencies) across projects.

## What You Can Do in a Workspace

Within a Workspace, you can:

* Move stories between projects via drag and drop
* [Search across multiple projects](/docs/advanced_search) and export results as CSV
* View your [My Work](/docs/managing_multiple_projects_workspaces#mywork_workspace) across all included projects
* Perform [bulk actions](/docs/updating_multiple_stories_quickly), such as adding/removing [labels](/docs/terminology#label) or deleting stories
* [Share your Workspace](/docs/sharing_workspaces) configuration with others via a shareable link

## Customizing Workspaces

* Create and manage multiple Workspaces to suit different workflows or teams
* Customize which project panels are visible and in what order
* Projects in a Workspace are automatically color-coded to keep everything visually organized
